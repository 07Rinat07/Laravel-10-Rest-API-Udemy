In this course you'll learn how to create a REST API using the web framework PHP. If you wish to build an app or single-page application with a backend system, the go to way is building REST API's. Luckily we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Popular web frameworks, like Laravel, allow us to quickly build amazing REST API's.

During this course we take a project-based approach to learning about REST API's using Laravel. We will build an API for a task manager. This will demonstrate the most common problems you'll experience during the development of your own REST API.

### During this course you will learn the following:

* Implement CRUD actions for REST Resources in Laravel.

* Make HTTP Requests using Postman.

* User authentication with Laravel Sanctum using API tokens.

* Sorting, Filtering and Pagination of lists of resources using the Laravel Query Builder package.
